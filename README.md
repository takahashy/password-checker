# Password Checker
Checks that the password you are using is secure by passing it through the API from haveibeenpwned.com. Consists of two files, "password_checker.py" and "passwords.txt",  where the python file is the program and the text file is a list of the passwords to be checked. 

# How to Run
In order to run the program the user can supply it "passwords.txt" or run the program without a file and enter the passwords separated by spaces once it prompts the user to input the passwords. 

    python3 password_checker.py [passwords.txt]
